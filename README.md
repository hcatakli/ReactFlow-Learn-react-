# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

React Code Practice is an interactive platform designed to help developers improve their React skills by offering hands-on coding exercises. The application provides a set of coding challenges with a focus on React, ranging from basic to advanced topics. It helps developers practice core React concepts, such as state management, hooks, components, and more, through practical exercises.


## Features

ðŸ’»**Code Challenges:** A variety of React-based coding challenges that progressively increase in difficulty.
ðŸ“Š**Exercise Tracker:** Users can track their progress and complete exercises at their own pace.
ðŸ’¡**Interactive Learning:** Each exercise comes with a detailed explanation and the possibility to try out the code.
ðŸŒŽ**Forum:** A space where users can share their learning experiences, ask questions, and discuss solutions.
ðŸ¥‡**User Profiles:** Users can create profiles to keep track of their activity and see how theyâ€™ve improved over time.


## Technologies Used##

**React:** For building the user interface and interactive elements.
**React Router:** For navigating between different pages within the app.
**Zustand:** For global state management.
**Expo Router:** For routing in the app.
**React Native:** To support mobile-first development.
